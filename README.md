# communiMap CO₂ Calculator - Project Showcase Website

## Project Overview

This repository contains the project showcase website for the Active Travel CO₂ Calculator, developed as part of the L2 Singapore Glasgow OIP coursework. The project explores innovative approaches to environmental behavior change through nature-based gamification, moving beyond traditional leaderboard systems to create emotionally meaningful engagement through forest visualization.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Research-Driven Design**: Grounded in Self-Determination Theory and environmental psychology
- **Forest Planting Gamification**: Revolutionary approach replacing boring leaderboards with tree growth visualizations
- **Community Integration**: Seamless integration with existing CommuniMap platform
- **Behavior Change Focus**: Evidence-based approach to sustainable transportation adoption

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a CO₂ tracking solution that integrates with CommuniMap
- Create engaging gamification that promotes active travel
- Research and apply behavior change psychology principles
- Establish sustainable community partnerships
