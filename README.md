# communiMap Forest Visualization - Design Innovation Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive project showcase website for the communiMap Forest CO₂ Tracking solution, developed as part of the L2 Singapore Glasgow OIP coursework. The project explores how nature-based gamification can motivate active travel behavior change, moving away from traditional competitive leaderboard systems to create intrinsically motivating forest visualization experiences.

## 🎯 Project Focus

**Core Problem**: Traditional CO₂ tracking apps fail to motivate sustained behavior change because they rely on competitive rankings and abstract numbers that don't create emotional connection to environmental impact.

**Our Solution**: Forest planting game that transforms walking and cycling into virtual tree growth, making environmental impact tangible and emotionally meaningful.
